    "\n",
    "## Types of Classification in Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tabular**\n",
    "    - Involves structured data with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or database table.\n",
    "    - Common tasks include regression (predicting continuous values) and classification (assigning categories to instances).\n",
    "    - Examples: Predicting house prices, customer churn prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Classification**\n",
    "    - Involves classifying images into predefined categories.\n",
    "    - Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning techniques.\n",
    "    - Examples: Identifying objects in images, facial recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Classification**\n",
    "    - Involves categorizing text into predefined categories.\n",
    "    - Uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.\n",
    "    - Examples:\n",
    "        - Email spam or ham detection\n",
    "        - Sentiment analysis\n",
    "        - Message categorization (e.g., sales vs. support)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Classification**: Two classes\n",
    "    - The task is to classify instances into one of two possible categories.\n",
    "    - Examples: Spam vs. ham emails, positive vs. negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiclass Classification**: More than two classes\n",
    "    - The task is to classify instances into one of three or more possible categories.\n",
    "    - Examples: Classifying news articles into sports, politics, entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilabel Classification**: Instances can belong to multiple classes\n",
    "    - Each instance can be assigned multiple labels.\n",
    "    - Examples: Classifying a news article as both sports and politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Email Filtering**\n",
    "    - Determine if an email is spam or ham.\n",
    "    - Example: Gmail's spam filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "    - Analyze sentiment in text data, such as reviews or social media posts.\n",
    "    - Example: Determining if a product review is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Language Detection**\n",
    "    - Identify the language of a given text.\n",
    "    - Example: Google Translate detecting the input language.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fake News Detection**\n",
    "    - Identify and classify news articles as real or fake.\n",
    "    - Uses NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze the content and metadata of news articles.\n",
    "    - Example: Platforms like Factmata and Fake News Challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition**\n",
    "   - Import data from various sources, such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.\n",
    "   - Example: Using pandas to load a dataset from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Clean and preprocess text data to make it suitable for analysis.\n",
    "   - Steps include:\n",
    "     - Converting text to lowercase\n",
    "     - Removing HTML tags\n",
    "     - Removing URLs\n",

    "     - Implementing chat word treatment\n",
    "     - Spelling correction\n",
    "     - Removing stopwords\n",
    "     - Handling emojis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Vectorization**\n",
    "   - Convert text to numerical vectors using methods such as:\n",
    "     - Bag of Words (BoW)\n",
    "     - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "     - Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modeling**\n",
    "   - Build and train models to classify text.\n",
    "   - Machine Learning models: Naive Bayes, Random Forest\n",
    "   - Deep Learning models: RNN, LSTM, CNN, BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**\n",
